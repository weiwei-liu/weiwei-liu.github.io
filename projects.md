[**Application of deep learning for sweet cherry phenotyping**](/2020-06-26-real-time-cherry-detection/) (capstone project)

> * Trained objection detection models for sweet cherry using YOLO convolutional neural network, which achieved over 99% accuracy and even surpassed human counting performance.
> * Extracted the size and color information from the model inference results, and built an excel database for information querying using Python.
> * Built an objection detection application to automate the process of sweet cherry counting and traits evaluation using OpenCV and Python.

[**Anomaly detection in operation trace logger of QNX embedded system products**](/2020-03-04-anomaly-detection/)

> * Transformed anomaly detection problem into sequence to sequence RNN model.
> * Developed an RNN model with attention layers that take into account the sequence of occurrence of event in the traces to identify anomalous section of logs that leads to anomalies using Tensorflow and Keras.
> * Designed an anomaly detection method using Support Vector Machine and achieved 100% accuracy when tested on complete log files, and the model could be used to perform anomaly detection in real time.

[**Sentiment analysis of app reviews**](https://github.com/weiwei-liu/reviews_sentiment_analysis)

> * Performed Exploratory Data Analytics, and Data Visualization on over 1 million reviews from Google Play.
> * Built and trained sentiment analysis models of app reviews based on NaiÌˆve Bayes Classifier and word embedding LSTM methods, with both recall accuracies over 90% using Python and Tensorflow.
