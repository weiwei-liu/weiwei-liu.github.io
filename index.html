<p>Hello! My name is Weiwei Liu and I am a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Developer in Canada.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve spent seven years in civil engineering design and consulting services, and proudly designed a dozen of projects. I wrangled with various kinds of data, performed numerical simulation and hypothesis analysis, and solved complex engineering problems with optimization techniques. </p>

<p>Now, with further education in data science, I work in more broad industries applying data analysis and machine learning techniques. My projects range from app review sentiment analysis using NLP tools, cherry detection with OpenCV and Yolo, to anomaly detection in embeded system log using deep learning.</p>

<p>If you want to contact me you can <a href="mailto:weiwei.liu2046@gmail.com">email me</a> or find me in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/weiweiliu/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
